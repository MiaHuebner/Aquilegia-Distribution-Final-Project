# Aquilegia-Distribution-Final-Project
Final Project for IP: Application Development Course at PLUS

  The main objective of this project was to perform a distribution analysis and Species Distribution Model (SDM) for Aquilegia formosa, or Western Columbine. General background on Aquilegia formosa as well as the distribution analysis to understand the range of Aquilegia formosa and is found in the AquilegiaFormosaInitialDistributionAnalysisQuarto.html file. Next, pseudo-absence data needs to be generated for the SDM. This workflow is provided in the Generating_Pseudo-Absence_Data.qmd file. The spatial block tiles also need to be generated to perform the SDM, which is found in the Generating_Spatial_Block_Tiles.qmd file. The final SDM, performed with the Generalized Linear Model, is found in the Final_Complete_SDM_Analysis.qmd file. 

  I was the only person running this analysis for this project. There were no other group members. 

AI USE DISCLAIMER! 
  ChatGPT was used throughout this project to help me understand different lines of code (especially in Damaris Zurrell's 2020 SDM workflow), help me find which package to use to perform a function (such as generating an interactive map with point data), and to help troubleshoot error messages that came up in my code. ChatGPT was mainly used as a means to understand what the code meant so I could understand how to best perform the analysis for the Aquilegia formosa species.
